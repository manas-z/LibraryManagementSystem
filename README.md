# LibraryManagementSystem
If you want to run this code  you will have to download the XAMPP server and turn it on. Then youll need to create a database called as 'library' and create the following tables:  book_issued, books, branches, library, member, member_login. After creating these following things the last thing that need to be done is filling the books database. Crosscheck with the codes what all content you need to have in the table and fill it. 
If interested there is one thing that can be changed in this project:
  1) You can create a trigger to update book to issued(in the books table) when someone issues a particular book(book_issued          table).
